# Nano Vaadin - Ramp up in a second.

A nano project to start a Vaadin project. 
Perfect for Micro-UIs packed as fat jar in a docker image.
This demo is bundled together with the Open Source APM tool called **stagemonitor**.

## Demo running on a local Docker
If you want to run this demo on your local machine, you can try out the 
docker image that is provided. 
To run this type:

```bash
docker pull nanovaadin/jetty-kotlin
docker run -p8899:8899 --name nano-jetty-kotlin nanovaadin/jetty-kotlin
```
After the images/container started you can try this demo with your local browser
by calling the following URL [http://localhost:8899](http://localhost:8899)

### cleaning up after trying
After you used this docker image you can clean up your system with the following commands.

```bash
docker rm nano-jetty-kotlin
docker image rm nanovaadin/jetty-kotlin
```

### building this Docker-image by yourself
If you want to build this docker image on your machine you can use the provided **Dockerfile**

```bash
docker build -t nanovaadin/jetty-kotlin .
```

## Demo running on Heroku
On Heroku you find a deployed version.
[https://nano-vaadin-jetty-kotlin.herokuapp.com/](https://nano-vaadin-jetty-kotlin.herokuapp.com/)

## How to build this locally?
If you want to build this demo check out the repository and invoke
the command: **mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dvaadin-install-nodejs**

Together with this demo, 
you will find some jUnit5 Selenium UI Tests based on **[Testbench](https://vaadin.com/testbench)** 
To get this running you need a license, or you can request a trial from [https://vaadin.com/trial](https://vaadin.com/trial)

## How to prepare a vaadin app for Heroku
To support the Heroku pipeline we need a few preparations.
1) the app must be able to get a configured port for the http port during the start up
1) add the shade plugin to create a fat jar
1) create the file **Procfile** and add the line 
    ``web: java -jar target/vaadin-app.jar -port $PORT```
    * **web** - to activate the web profile
    * **-jar** - define what fat jar must be started
    * **-port** make the dynamic associated port available for the app
1) add a file **settings.xml** to configure the maven build process
    
## Supported JDK
This example is running from JDK8 up to JDK13

## target of this project
The target of this project is a minimal rampup time for a first hello world.
Why we need one more HelloWorld? Well, the answer is quite easy. 
If you have to try something out, or you want to make a small POC to present something,
there is no time and budget to create a demo project.
You donÂ´t want to copy paste all small things together.
Here you will get a Nano-Project that will give you all in a second.

Clone the repo and start editing the file ```NanoVaadinOnKotlin.kt```.
Nothing more. 

## How does it work?
Internally it will ramp up a Jetty. If you want to see how this is done, have a look inside
the class ```CoreUIService```.

## How a developer can use this
You as a developer can use it like it is shown in the demo folder inside the src path.

```kotlin
fun main() {
  CoreUIService().startup()
}
```


```kotlin
@Route("")
class VaadinApp : Composite<Div>(), HasLogger {

  private val btnClickMe = Button("click me")
  private val lbClickCount = Span("0")
  private val layout = VerticalLayout(btnClickMe, lbClickCount)

  private var clickcount = 0

  init {
    btnClickMe.setId(BTN_CLICK_ME)
    btnClickMe.addClickListener { event -> lbClickCount.text = (++clickcount).toString() }

    lbClickCount.setId(LB_CLICK_COUNT)

    logger().info("and now..  setting the main content.. ")
    content.add(layout)
  }

  companion object {

    val BTN_CLICK_ME = "btn-click-me"
    val LB_CLICK_COUNT = "lb-click-count"
  }
}
```
